Grade: 70

You were required to sort using heaps (per the question), not use heap-sort, which is a sorting technique. Your grade is broken down in the rubric, and here are some comments -
1. A function to delete the heap's root (largest element) is missing.
2. The sorting itself does not function correctly. [Corrected]
