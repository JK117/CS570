Grade: 80

1.  Start/stop not working as expected. When a router is started/stopped, 
    the entries in every other router's routing table seem to be duplicate entries of the router itself. 
    These entries do not correct themselves despite multiple 'C' commands. 

2.  A router must not have an entry for itself in its own routing table.
